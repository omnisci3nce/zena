# Zena

Lightweight messenging (as in chat) server and client.
Heavily **WIP** as this is just an hour here and there kind of project.

`cargo run --bin client`

### database migrations

I've been using the [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate) utility for running
database migrations. From `db/` run `dbmate create` and `dbmate up` to run migrations.

## goals

Goals:
* simple setup and compilation to make contributing easy
* lightweight
* support screenshare (maybe via OBS somehow?)
* simple GUI

Non-goals (subject to change):
* decentralisation & federation

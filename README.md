# Zena

Lightweight messenging (as in chat) server and client.

## goals

Goals:

- simple setup and compilation to make contributing easy
- lightweight
- support screenshare (maybe via OBS somehow?)
- simple GUI

Non-goals (subject to change):

- decentralisation & federation

## how to run

Currently, the steps for my (Josh) test code is

- `node testserver.js`
- `odin run bin/j_client.odin -file -- 3000`
